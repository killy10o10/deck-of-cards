# Killy's Game of War

> This is an An Api based game with cards from https://www.deckofcardsapi.com. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards. The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck‚Äîthis is a "battle"‚Äîand the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack.
